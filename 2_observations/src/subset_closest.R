#' Match each site point to an edge (reach), preferring edges for which the
#' downstream vertex (endpoint) is close to the site point
#'
#' Algorithm: Locate the nearest reach. If the nearest point is downstream, then
#' return a match to that nearest reach. If the nearest reach endpoint (vertex)
#' is upstream, and either (1) there is no branching at the upstream vertex or
#' (2) the upstream vertex is >4x closer than the downstream vertex, then return
#' a match to the nearest upstream reach. Still report bird_dist_to_subseg_m as
#' the distance to the initially identified nearest reach.
